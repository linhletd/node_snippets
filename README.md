## Reflection

This was a several months long project built after I had completed a bunch of coding challenges, projects on freecodecamp.org and had many important knowledges from 'You Don't Know JS' with thought - I must build something real.
 
Originally, during reading Mastering Node.js book and writing some snippets a long with what i had learnt from it that was the reason behind the name of this repository - *node_snippets*. While writing snippets about *authentication* and *websocket*, i started expanding them into this 'real' project.

One of the main challenges I ran into was building *editor app* from "scratch" without using obsoleted `execCommand` API. its functionality helps users create posts (topics) easily. Deadlog after deadlog, bug after bug, leading me to spend over one and half of month to complete.

At the end of the day, the technologies applied in this project are Node, React, React-Router-DOM, Redux, Websocket, MongoDB, MySQL and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. Thank to Webpack, i didn't worry about how to implement modules or intergrate babel on frontend.

Finally, thank to this [README.md](https://gist.github.com/martensonbj/6bf2ec2ed55f5be723415ea73c4557c4) template, it made me feel comfortable to write my own.
